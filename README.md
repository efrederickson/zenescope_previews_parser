This project scrapes every release from the diamond previews website (previewsworld.com) by performing
a search month-by-month. While this one filters on the publisher Zenescope it could be changed to work
with anything to acquire releases. I did no research to see if they allow 3rd party use of their API but
only had to run it once to grab all the data, so...

I made this because there is no maintained list of graphic novels Zenescope released. The code isn't 
pretty, but it worked well enough to build a list of graphic novels I could compare to my collection to
see what's missing.
